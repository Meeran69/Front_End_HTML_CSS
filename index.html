                <p>This is my first website, i don't have much to share about myself so i'll let you know about my experiece with a game called 'Apex Legends'.</p>
                <p><em>It all began in the summer of 2019, when i first laid my hands on Apex legends. After one match, i knew i was going to be hooked. </em></p>
                <p><em>Apex Legends was the first competitive game i played, but surprisingly i was good as compared to other players, maybe because i used to play Call Of Duty on the hardest difficulty. </em></p></td>

    <h3>Platforms and Interests</h3>
    <p><em>I started my gaming experience when i was 6 years old. Since then it has been a rollercoaster, from moments where i kept losing and wanted to pull my hair out, to feeling joy after winning a difficult boss fight. <em></p>
<p>The games i've played are too many to mention but it has alwasy been a unique experience. Some games that i really like are:</p>
 <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-of-us-remastered/">The Last Of Us</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne/"> Bloodborne</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a></li>

 </ul>
 <p>All games can be divided into two categories:</p>
 <ol>
     <li> Online Multiplayer</li>
     <li>Offline Singleplayer</li>
